It is an e-commerce web application that allows users to purchase and sell books. 
We used Nodejs, MongoDB, and a few other cutting-edge technologies to create this application.Except for Admin, there are two sorts of vendors: Publishers and Users.
Publishers are another type of user that add their books and keep track of their ratings and reviews, as well as their buying system. Users can purchase books based on their wish list, as well as through online transactions. STRIPE is a demonstration payment mechanism that we employ. The user can pay for his order with his Visa card, or cash on delivery is also an option. Our program allows users to track their orders.
